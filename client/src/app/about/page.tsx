                                <p className="text-lg">gymskii was founded by Sam Kotecha, who tracked his progression through an Excel sheet. He always wanted to see how his stats looked visually, 
                                    hence gymskii was born He tried other tracking apps but most are made by people who don't truly appreciate fitness and understand how it works today. We hope gymskii 
                                    delivers what you need.</p>
